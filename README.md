# linter-apache-configtest

This plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) is a frontend to
the configtest function of [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/httpd.html).

## Installation

This plugin depends on the Linter package, which will automatically be
installed for you upon activation.

You'll also need a functioning installation of Apache httpd. The plugin can be
configured to use a specific entry executable, whether that's `apachectl`,
`httpd`, or something else entirely.
